# STAT1000J Project

My name is Hao Liang(梁昊)，student ID: 520370910094. Email: lh20020727@sjtu.edu.cn

This is my final project of STAT1000J!

I analyze datasets of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Most code are in `project.ipynb` and some important functions are defined in `main.py`. 

As part of my data analytics project, I've extracted data from three unique HLTV websites. To prepare for any potential changes to these sites, I've thought ahead and downloaded the  `html`  files for each one. This ensures that I can always access this valuable data for future analysis, no matter what happens to the live website. They are names as:

-  `CS_GO Player CT statistics database _ HLTV.org.html`

- `CS_GO Player statistics database _ HLTV.org.html`

- `CS_GO Player T statistics database _ HLTV.org.html`

There are three folders with the same names as this three `html` file. They contains all pictures on these websites.

In the prediction part, I use the dataset from  [Bogachev, Y. (2022). CSGO Dataset. GitHub.](https://github.com/YuvalBogachev/csgo-dataset). This dataset is named as `csgo_player_stats.csv`.
